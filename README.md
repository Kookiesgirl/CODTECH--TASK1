Project Overview: Housing Price Prediction Web Application
This project is a full-stack application that predicts housing prices based on user-input features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. It integrates front-end design, back-end development, and machine learning into a seamless and interactive experience.

Core Components:
Front-End (HTML & CSS):

A user-friendly web form designed to collect housing details.
Clean, responsive design using CSS for a professional look.
Back-End (Flask in Python):

Handles form submissions and processes user inputs.
Connects the front-end to the machine learning model for predictions.
Machine Learning Model:

Trained on the Boston Housing Dataset using Linear Regression.
Preprocessed data using scaling to ensure accurate predictions.
Provides quick and reliable estimates for housing prices.
How It Works:
Users input details like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location into the form.
The Flask back-end processes these inputs and scales the features.
The pre-trained Linear Regression model predicts the price.
The predicted price is displayed on a new page.
Purpose and Applications:
Demonstrates how machine learning can be integrated into web applications.
Serves as a learning tool for combining front-end and back-end technologies with data science.
Offers practical insights into the real-world use of predictive models.
This project is ideal for exploring how to turn machine learning models into interactive tools for end users.
